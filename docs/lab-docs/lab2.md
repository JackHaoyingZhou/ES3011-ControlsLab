# Lab 2: Mathematical Modeling I

<!-- ###### Description
* Learn how to develop mathematical models of physical dynamic systems. This would include:
    * Mass-spring-damper
    * ~~RLC circuit~~
    * DC motor
    * Self-balancing robot

###### What to Submit
* Report showing a summary of exercises completed for MATLAB and Simulink.
    * MATLAB code showing the state-space model of each dynamic systems -->
<!-- 
!!! note 
    We need to experimentally obtain the dynamic parameters of the self-balancing robot
     -->

#### Introduction

Welcome to the second session of the ES3011 experimental labs. 

1. Mathematical modeling of basic dynamical systems

2. Mathematical modeling of self-balancing robot system

##### Learning Outcomes
You should be able to:

* Understand and describe the dynamical system using mathematically using differential equations
* Convert the differential equations to state-space model form by hand and using MATLAB functionality

#### 1. Mathematical Modeling of Basic Dynamical Systems

In this section, you will develop mathematical models for basic dynamical systems considered in control systems such as the mass-spring-damper and the DC motor. These models will then be put into state-space representation which will be used in future lab sessions for simulation and analysis.

##### Instructions:
In this lab [instruction sheet](../documents/Lab2.pdf),

* Review the MATLAB Intro section
* Complete problems I (Mass-spring-damper) and IV (Motor position)
